Sculptor is an open source productivity tool that applies the concepts from [Domain-Driven Design](http://domaindrivendesign.org/books/) and [Domain Specific Languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language).

You express your design intent in a textual specification (within an Eclipse editor), from which Sculptor generates (with a Maven plugin) high quality Java code and configuration. You can use the concepts from Domain-Driven Design (DDD) in the textual Domain Specific Language (DSL). E.g. Service, Module, Entity, Value Object, Repository.

The generated code is based on well-known frameworks, such as [JPA](http://java.sun.com/javaee/technologies/persistence.jsp), [Hibernate](http://www.hibernate.org/), [Spring Framework](http://www.springframework.org/), [Spring Web Flow](http://www.springframework.org/webflow), [JSF](http://java.sun.com/javaee/javaserverfaces/) and [Java EE](http://java.sun.com/javaee/). Sculptor takes care of the technical details, the tedious repetitive work, and let you focus on delivering more business value - and have more fun.
